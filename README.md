# Resume

This repo contains my resume.

A Rust binary generates a LaTex file by using a templating engine, [Tera](https://tera.netlify.app/docs/), configured by [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/).

[github-action-for-latex](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-action-for-latex) compiles the generated latex file to a PDF


Both the LaTex and PDF files are uploaded as assets to this repo's releases.
